# JWT Authentication Solution

## Summary of Implemented Authentication Architecture

The authentication system has been successfully updated to work with Supabase JWT tokens from the frontend. It now properly validates tokens and provides both development and production authentication paths.

## Key Components

1. **Core Authentication Components**:
   - `auth_adapter.py` - Token verification and user profile retrieval
   - `auth_endpoints.py` - Authentication-related API endpoints
   - `user_profile_manager.py` - Profile management utilities

2. **Development & Testing Utilities**:
   - `jwt_debug.py` - JWT token analysis and debugging
   - `test_direct_auth.py` - Basic token verification testing
   - `test_jwt_validation.py` - Direct token validation testing
   - `test_authenticated_profile.py` - Full auth flow testing with profiles
   - `create_test_profile.py` - Script for creating test profiles in Supabase

## Authentication Flow

1. Client sends request with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
2. Server verifies token signature and claims (exp, aud="authenticated")
3. Server retrieves or creates test user profile
4. Request is processed with authenticated user context

## Development vs Production Mode

The system now supports both development and production modes:

- **Production Mode**:
  - Strict token validation
  - Requires matching profiles in database
  - No test profiles are created

- **Development Mode** (activated by `DEV_MODE=true`):
  - Same token validation as production
  - Creates test profiles if needed
  - Allows testing without database setup

## User Profile Management

User profiles are stored in three tables:
- `job_seeker_profiles`
- `partner_profiles`
- `admin_profiles`

The system automatically detects which profile type to use based on the token claims.

## Testing Endpoints

Special testing endpoints have been added:
- `/api/auth/test-auth` - Simple token verification
- `/api/auth/debug-token` - Token debugging and analysis

## Fixed Issues

The following authentication issues have been resolved:

1. **JWT Verification**:
   - Added correct audience claim validation (`aud="authenticated"`)
   - Disabled IAT validation to prevent time sync issues
   - Enhanced error handling and token validation

2. **Profile Handling**:
   - Added fallback for missing profiles in development mode
   - Fixed Pydantic validation errors by including required fields
   - Added more detailed error messages for debugging

3. **Development Experience**:
   - Added DEV_MODE toggle for easier testing
   - Created debug endpoints and utilities
   - Added test profile creation script

## Test Results

The implemented authentication system passes the following tests:

1. **JWT Token Validation Tests**:
   - ✅ Valid tokens are correctly verified
   - ✅ Expired tokens are rejected in production mode
   - ✅ Tokens with incorrect audience are rejected
   - ✅ Tampered tokens are rejected

2. **API Endpoint Tests**:
   - ✅ `/api/v1/health` endpoint is accessible without authentication
   - ✅ `/api/auth/test-auth` endpoint validates tokens correctly
   - ✅ `/api/auth/debug-token` endpoint provides detailed token analysis
   - ⚠️ `/api/auth/status` endpoint requires Supabase configuration for full functionality

## Usage Examples

**Running in Development Mode**:
```bash
DEV_MODE=true python run_server.py
```

**Testing JWT Validation**:
```bash
python test_jwt_validation.py
```

**Testing Direct Auth**:
```bash
python test_direct_auth.py
```

**Creating a Test Profile**:
```bash
python scripts/create_test_profile.py --user-id=test-user-123 --profile-type=job_seeker
```

## Further Improvements

1. **Caching**: Add token/profile caching for improved performance
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Enhance permissions based on profile type
3. **Admin Panel**: Create UI for managing user profiles
