# Backend Consolidation Plan

## Current Situation Analysis

After analyzing the backend directory structure, I've identified the following key issues:

1. **Duplication between teams/ and agents/ directories**:
   - Both have agent implementations but with different approaches
   - teams/ has a more advanced implementation with LangGraph integration
   - agents/ has a simpler implementation with basic coordination

2. **Duplication between teams/api/ and api/ directories**:
   - teams/api/server.py contains advanced FastAPI implementation
   - api/main.py contains similar but slightly different FastAPI setup

3. **Empty or incomplete directories**:
   - config/ has a settings.py file but may need additional configuration files
   - utils/ is empty and needs population with utility functions

## Consolidation Strategy

### 1. Agent System Consolidation

**Decision**: Merge the best parts of teams/agents/ and agents/ into a unified agents/ structure.

**Actions**:
- Keep backend/agents/base/agent_base.py as it aligns with LangGraph patterns
- Incorporate advanced features from teams/base/agent_base.py into agents/base/agent_base.py
- Consolidate teams/agents/ agent implementations into agents/implementations/
- Integrate teams/core/coordinator.py functionality with agents/coordinator.py
- Preserve semantic routing capabilities from both implementations

### 2. API Consolidation

**Decision**: Use backend/api/ as the primary API directory with enhancements from teams/api/.

**Actions**:
- Keep the current FastAPI setup in api/main.py
- Integrate advanced endpoint patterns from teams/api/server.py
- Ensure proper route organization in api/routes/
- Maintain the middleware structure in api/middleware/

### 3. LangGraph Framework Integration

**Decision**: Move teams/langgraph/ content to a new agents/langgraph/ directory.

**Actions**:
- Create agents/langgraph/ directory
- Copy teams/langgraph/framework.py to agents/langgraph/framework.py
- Update imports and references

### 4. Adapter Consolidation

**Decision**: Move useful adapters from teams/adapters/ to appropriate locations.

**Actions**:
- Move teams/adapters/redis_adapter.py to database/redis_adapter.py if it offers additional functionality

### 5. Utils Directory Population

**Decision**: Create essential utility files in the utils/ directory.

**Actions**:
- Create utils/logger.py for standardized logging
- Create utils/error_handling.py for global error handling
- Create utils/memory_manager.py based on teams functionality
- Create utils/optimization.py for performance optimizations

### 6. Config Directory Validation

**Decision**: Verify and enhance the config/ directory.

**Actions**:
- Ensure settings.py has all necessary configuration options
- Add agent_config.py for agent-specific configurations if needed

## Implementation Plan

1. Create backup of current structure
2. Implement agent system consolidation
3. Implement API consolidation
4. Integrate LangGraph framework
5. Consolidate adapters
6. Populate utils directory
7. Validate config directory
8. Update imports and references throughout the codebase
9. Test functionality after consolidation
