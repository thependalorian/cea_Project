## üìö Knowledge Resources Access Analysis

### Database Status:
- **‚úÖ knowledge_resources:** 4 records available (domains: policy, workforce)
- **‚ùå job_postings:** Table does not exist
- **‚ùå training_programs:** Table does not exist
- **‚ùå resume_data:** Table does not exist

### Knowledge Access Patterns:
1. **Pendo:** Partner resources
2. **Jasmine:** Training resources (limited)
3. **Marcus:** None (non-functional)
4. **Liv:** None (non-functional)
5. **Miguel:** All resource types (training, job, partner, funding)

### Critical Database Issues:
- Missing core tables: `job_postings`, `training_programs`, `resume_data`
- Limited knowledge base with only 4 resources
- User context unavailable due to missing resume data

---

## üîß Tool Usage Analysis

### Tool Integration by Agent:
- **Pendo:** 0 tools (routing only)
- **Jasmine:** 0 tools (test mode)
- **Marcus:** N/A (non-functional)
- **Liv:** N/A (non-functional)
- **Miguel:** 7 tools per query
  - `community_analysis` (5x per query)
  - `upskilling_recommendations`
  - `job_matching`

### Tool Performance:
- **Miguel** demonstrates excellent tool integration
- Tools are being called multiple times per query (possibly inefficient)
- Analytics logging is working properly for Miguel

## üéØ Personalization Analysis

### Personalization Scores (0-10 scale):
- **Pendo:** 3/10
- **Jasmine:** 2/10
- **Marcus:** 0/10 (non-functional)
- **Liv:** 0/10 (non-functional)
- **Miguel:** 3/10

### Personalization Limitations:
- No user profile data available (profile: null)
- No resume data available (resume: null)
- No job seeker profile data (job_seeker: null)

- Marcus and Liv agents are abstract classes without concrete implementations
- Missing `process` method implementations
- Cannot be instantiated for actual use

### 2. **Database Schema Issues:**
- Core tables missing: `job_postings`, `training_programs`, `resume_data`
- Limited knowledge resources (only 4 records)
- User context completely unavailable

### 3. **Personalization Gaps:**
- No user-specific data available for personalization
- Agents cannot access user resume, profile, or job seeker data
- Generic responses without context

2. **Database Schema:** Create missing tables (`job_postings`, `training_programs`, `resume_data`)
3. **Knowledge Base:** Populate with more comprehensive resources
4. **User Context:** Ensure user profile and resume data is available

### Agent Improvements:
1. **Jasmine:** Implement actual agent with tool integration
2. **Marcus:** Complete veteran specialist implementation
3. **Liv:** Complete international specialist implementation
4. **All Agents:** Improve personalization with user context

### System Enhancements:
1. **Tool Efficiency:** Optimize Miguel's tool usage (reduce redundant calls)
2. **Knowledge Resources:** Expand database with job and training data
3. **Personalization:** Implement user context retrieval and usage
4. **Analytics:** Extend analytics to all agents

## üéØ Conclusion

The comprehensive testing reveals a **mixed implementation status** with significant opportunities for improvement:

**Strengths:**
- Miguel (Environmental Justice) is fully functional and exemplary
- Pendo (Supervisor) provides proper routing and mission alignment
- Tool integration and analytics work well where implemented
- CEA.md mission integration is consistent

**Critical Gaps:**
- 40% of agents (Marcus, Liv) are non-functional
- Database schema is incomplete
- User personalization is severely limited
- Knowledge resources are minimal

**Priority Focus:**
1. Complete agent implementations for Marcus and Liv
2. Fix database schema and populate knowledge resources
3. Implement user context retrieval for personalization
4. Extend successful patterns from Miguel to other agents

The system shows strong potential with Miguel demonstrating the target functionality, but requires significant development to achieve full operational status across all agents.
